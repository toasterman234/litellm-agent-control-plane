/*
 * opencode inline adapter — makes attached skills LOADABLE on the single shared
 * `opencode serve` (the opencode-brain-inline harness).
 *
 * Why an adapter at all: opencode discovers skills from disk at session-create
 * time, and the platform delivers an agent's skills as SandboxFileSpec entries
 * in the POST /session `files` array. opencode *does* write that array, but only
 * after the session is created — too late for the new session to discover them.
 * So this adapter writes the skill files to the shared global skills dir
 * (~/.claude/skills) BEFORE forwarding session-create, so opencode picks them up
 * for that turn.
 *
 * Skills are written to the shared dir (not a per-agent directory): on this
 * shared server every agent sees every attached skill. We deliberately do NOT
 * pin sessions to a per-agent `?directory` — opencode's `/event` bus is
 * directory-scoped, and the UI's `/event` subscription has no directory, so a
 * per-session directory would hide the live transcript (the chat would hang on
 * "thinking…" even though the turn completed).
