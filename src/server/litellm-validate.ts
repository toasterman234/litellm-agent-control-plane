/**
 * Validate that a model string actually routes to a working upstream
 * provider through the LiteLLM gateway.
 *
 * Background: LiteLLM's `/v1/models` advertises any model name configured
 * in the proxy's `model_list`, but proxy admins frequently add dated
 * variants (e.g. `anthropic/claude-opus-4-7-20260416`) whose upstream
 * provider doesn't recognize them. Such a model is listed but returns 404
 * on the first real chat. Today the platform stores those model strings
 * without checking, so agents save fine and then EVERY session created
 * from them fails the moment a user types — a confusing failure mode
 * because the agent looks healthy in the UI.
 *
 * This helper sends a minimal 1-token completion to LiteLLM up front so
 * the platform rejects broken model strings at agent create/update time
 * with a clear error message that includes the upstream provider's own
 * error, plus a hint to use the bare-alias form when that's what failed.
 */

/**
 * Ping LiteLLM's chat-completions endpoint with the given model and a
 * 1-token "hi" body. Throws an HttpError(400, …) on any 4xx response so
 * the caller's request bubbles up the upstream error to the user.
 *
 * 5xx and network errors are treated as transient — they should not
 * block agent save. Operators don't want their workflow gated on a
 * flaky upstream.
